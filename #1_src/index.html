				<h3 class="poem__title">The End Poem.</h3>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">I see the player you mean.</p>
				<p id="poem-name-1" class="poem__text"></p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read
					our thoughts.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">That doesn’t matter. It thinks we are part of the game.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in
					the dream of a
					game.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring
					at the reality behind the screen.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the
					days when those
					who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the
					air, on sticks powered by demons.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">What did this player dream?</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It
					dreamed it
					created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.
				</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what
					true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?</p>
				<p class="poem__text">It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">the <span id="glitch-1"></span>, and created a <span id="glitch-2"></span> for <span id="glitch-3"></span>, in the <span id="glitch-4"></span>.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">It cannot read that thought.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must
					achieve in the long
					dream of life, not the short dream of a game.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the
					universe, yes.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no
					summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its
					own private task.
					We cannot interfere.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building
					true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe.
					Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the
					word they fear.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">It reads our thoughts.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for
					truth is merely <span id="glitch-5"></span> and <span id="glitch-6"></span>, I wish to tell them
					that they are <span id="glitch-7"></span> in the <span id="glitch-8"></span>. They see
					so little of reality, in their long dream.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">And yet they play the game.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">But it would be so easy to tell them...</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent
				</p>
				<p class="poem__text">them living.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">I will not tell the player how to live.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">The player is growing restless.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">I will tell the player a story.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">But not the truth.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked
					truth that can burn over any distance.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Give it a body, again.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Yes. Player…</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Use its name.</p>
				<p id="poem-name-2" class="poem__text"></p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Good.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return.
					Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There
					you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things.
					As though we were separate things.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain.
					Father sun, mother
					moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels.
					Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">We are the universe. We are everything you think isn’t you. You are looking at us
					now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on
					you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Once upon a time, there was a player.</p>
				<p id="poem-name-3" class="poem__text poem__text--blue"></p>
				<p class="poem__text">Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten
					rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty
					thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross
					the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty
					million kilometres away.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was
					flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and
					death was a temporary inconvenience.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these
					dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream
					into another, then woke from that into a third.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Let’s go back.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in
					the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the
					player, in her body.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother’s body, into the
					long dream.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And
					the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And
					the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from
					nothing but milk
					and love.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Let’s go further back.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player’s body were created, long
					before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the
					player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a
					flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world
					created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by…</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that
					was soft and warm
					and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in
					its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks
					“electrons” and “protons”.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Sometimes it called them “planets” and “stars”.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made
					of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game.
					Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">You are the player, reading words…</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Shush… Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into
					words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the
					player started to breath faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand
					deaths had not been real, the player was alive</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">You. You. You are alive.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the
					sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it
					through the light
					that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player’s
					eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to
					be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly
					smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros
					and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end
					of a dream</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">and the universe said I love you</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and the universe said you have played the game well</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">and the universe said everything you need is within you</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and the universe said you are stronger than you know</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">and the universe said you are the daylight</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and the universe said you are the night</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and the universe said the light you seek is within you</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">and the universe said you are not alone</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself,
					talking to itself,
					reading its own code</p>
				<p class="poem__text">and the universe said I love you because you are love.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And
					the player began
					a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the
					player was love.</p>
				<p class="poem__text poem__text--blue">You are the player.</p>
				<p class="poem__text">Wake up.</p>
